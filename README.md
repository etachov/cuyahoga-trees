# Urban Tree Canopy and Income, Cuyahoga County

These charts illustrate this [Belt Magazine article](http://beltmag.com/money-trees/) on environmental and income disparities in the greater Cleveland area. 

The tree canopy data is from Cuyahoga County's 2013 [Urban Tree Canopy Assessment](http://cuyahoga.org/canopy/downloads.html) and the income data is from the U.S. Census [American Community Survey] (http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) 2013 estimate.  

The three charts this code creates (two of which ran in the article) are presented below:
