# Urban Tree Canopy and Income, Cuyahoga County

These charts illustrate this <a href="http://beltmag.com/money-trees/" target="_blank"> Belt Magazine article</a> on environmental and income disparities in the greater Cleveland area. 

The tree canopy data is from Cuyahoga County's 2013 <a href="http://cuyahoga.org/canopy/downloads.html" target="_blank"> Urban Tree Canopy Assessment</a> and the income data is from the U.S. Census <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml" target="_blank"> American Community Survey</a> 2013 estimate.

The three charts this code creates (two of which ran in the article) are presented below:
